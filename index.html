<h2>Some Test Projects</h2>

<p2>*You don't need to click the fire button, just hold down Mouse 1</p2>

<a href="rgp.html">Randomly Generated Paths Test</a>
<br>
<p>*If it feels as though your clicks aren't registering because the path won't change, it's because there are only two paths for is to choose. It's like a coin flip, if you flip it a hundred times, it's not gonna be split 50/50</p>
<a href="wwc.html">Wentworth Clicker</a>
<p>*This was a little test game I created when I learned someone at my school made a clicker game, so I wanted to try it out, I asked my friend if I could use his face and the rest is a cluncky unfinished mess. Enjoy!</p>
